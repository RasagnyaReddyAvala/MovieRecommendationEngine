# MovieRecommendationEngine
The aim of this project was to build a movie recommendation engine using the TMDB datasets as well as
Full MovieLens datasets. Popular streaming websites such as Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu etc. use some sort
of an algorithm to recommend shows and movies to their users, based on their specific behavior.
In this project we have attempted to build 4 types of movie recommendation engines - weighted-rating
based, sentiment based, content-based and user-based.
